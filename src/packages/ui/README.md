# @fredrikkadolfsson/ui

Component library based on [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). The component library is built to:

- Acting as a proxy if the decision of transitioning from Material UI occur.
- Enable sharing of components between projects.
  - Minimizing the time spent taking care of implementations.
  - Keeping the style consistent.
